## Configuration

### To configure the application to use AWS S3 services, follow these detailed steps:
## **1. Generate a Master Key If you do not already have a master.key file**
- **Generate the `master.key`**:
  - If your project requires encrypted credentials, Rails generates a `master.key` file during the initial setup. This file is essential for decrypting your `config/credentials.yml.enc` file, which contains sensitive information.
  - If you don't have a `master.key`, you can generate one with:
    ```bash
    EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit
    ```
    This command will create both the `master.key` and `config/credentials.yml.enc` if they don't exist.
  
- **Store the `master.key` Securely**:
  - Ensure it's listed in your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits.
  - You can add the following line to your `.gitignore`:
    ```
    /config/master.key
    ```

## **2. AWS S3 Configuration**
- **Setting Up AWS Credentials**:
  - Ensure you have your AWS credentials stored securely. These credentials are needed to access your S3 bucket where image are stored.
  - Add the following AWS-related environment variables to your `.env` file (you might need to create this file if it doesnâ€™t exist):
    ```bash
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
    AWS_REGION=your_region
    S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
    ```
  
- **Updating `storage.yml`**:
  - Ensure your `config/storage.yml` file is correctly configured for AWS S3:
    ```yaml
    amazon:
      service: S3
      access_key_id: <%= ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] %>
      secret_access_key: <%= ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] %>
      region: <%= ENV['AWS_REGION'] %>
      bucket: <%= ENV['S3_BUCKET_NAME'] %>
    ```
    

### **3. Environment Variables**
- **Setting Up `.env` File**:
  - To keep your environment variables organized and secure, create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project:
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```
    Ensure this file is added to your `.gitignore`:
    ```
    .env
    ```

- **Essential Environment Variables**:
  - Ensure the following variables are set in your `.env` file:
    ```bash
    SECRET_KEY_BASE=your_secret_key_base
    DEVISE_SECRET_KEY=your_devise_secret_key
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
    AWS_REGION=your_region
    S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
    DATABASE_USERNAME=your_db_username
    DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_db_password
    ```

- **Generating `SECRET_KEY_BASE` and `DEVISE_SECRET_KEY`**:
  - If you don't have a `SECRET_KEY_BASE` or `DEVISE_SECRET_KEY`, you can generate them using:
    ```bash
    rails secret
    ```
    Use the output as the value for these keys in your `.env` file.

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Issues**:
  - Ensure that PostgreSQL is running and the database configurations in `database.yml` are correct.
  
- **AWS S3 Issues**:
  - Double-check your AWS credentials and ensure that your S3 bucket is correctly configured.
  
- **Missing Migrations**:
  - Run `rails db:migrate` if you encounter any database-related errors.
  
- **JavaScript/CSS Not Loading**:
  - Make sure assets are compiled by running:
    ```bash
    rails assets:precompile
    ```

- **Port Already in Use**:
  - If you encounter an error related to the port being in use, either stop the running process using the port or change the port by running:
    ```bash
    rails server -p 3001
    ```
